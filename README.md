# Kaggel-Predict-Survival-on-Titanic-
Classification, Python, SVM, kNN, Random Forest, LDA

For the project on Kaggle (Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), I carried out data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection on the Titanic dataset. I applied machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, neural network, SVM, k-NN, random forest and LDA/QDA to predict survival on the Titanic.
